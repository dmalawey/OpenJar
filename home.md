**Our Mission**  
We aim to make open hardware as accessible and collaborative as open-source software. Our mission is to:  
- Encourage sustainability by repurposing common items, such as mason jars.  
- Provide parametric designs for flexibility and customization.  
- Develop a robust open-source ecosystem where contributions are straightforward and impactful.

**Adapter Threads**  
The adapter thread system enables modularity and easy printing without supports. Each adapter consists of two parts: the lid adapter and the thread component.

**Spray Bottle Adapter**  
Uses `lid_adapt.stl` and `thread_spray.stl`.

**Foamy Dispenser Adapter**  
Uses `Lid_foamy.stl` and `thread_foamy.stl`.

**Rubber Seal for Food Storage**  
For food storage, consider using a silicone rubber seal such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV).
